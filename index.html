            <h3> What’s Cajun French Fusion?</h3>
            <p>Cajuns—Fun-loving Acadians from Nova Scotia who settled in the south in the 19th century—are
                known for their pleasure-lovin’ nature and joy of living. They like excitement in life, and food is no
                exception. When they settled in the south, they created their own rustic style of eating known as
                Cajun, using local ingredients to create meals. We’ve taken this to heart by sourcing the freshest
                ingredients directly from local organic farms and suppliers.
                Ironically, Cajun cuisine first developed out of necessity. The Acadian refugees were pretty broke
                after their British expulsion. So they settled in the U.S. and learned how to live off the land and
                adapted their native French rustic cuisine to local ingredients including rice, sugar cane and the
                bounty provided by the sea. Traditional Cajun cuisine grew from of supplementing rice with
                whatever meat, game or other proteins were available to serve their large families. Adding some
                zest and excitement to basic ol’ seafood became the Cajun trademark. If you’ve never been
                down south before, experiencing the Cajun culture is like no other experience you’ll ever have.
                We believe that food is a treat for all the senses. Here at The Saint Lawrence we have elevated
                traditional rustic food into a visual feast as well as a gastronomic one. We lean heavily on our
                French influence by offering a daily menu of three-course lunch and dinner options.
                We believe your meal with us should be a luxurious experience from the first moment you are
                graciously greeted at our door to the last delicious morsel. We encourage you to step in, sit down
                and enjoy your time with us.
